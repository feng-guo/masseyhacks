					BlockList is a chrome extension in which trigger warnings are given at the discovery of content that a viewer may be offended by on a page. BlockList looks for keywords from a series of lists selected by the user. If any of the  keywords appear on a website, a popup appears that notifies the user and the potentially offensive topic that the website may contain.
